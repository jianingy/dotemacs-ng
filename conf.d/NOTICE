1. While the :after keyword delays loading until the dependencies are loaded, the somewhat simpler :requires keyword simply never loads the package if the dependencies are not available at the time the use-package declaration is encountered. By "available" in this context it means that foo is available if (featurep 'foo) evaluates to a non-nil value.
